==========

rename test ARs and Es to be more descriptive
thread safe event store naming of Action(string) method
have the ARId in Event and Commands with a constructor override to the default ctor?
have a default Message object that Command and Event inherit from?

null checks for eventcomparer.equals && .gethashcode?
CreateParticipantCommandIsNotValidHandler is not fully fleshed out
tests for TestEventStore
verify that the commands ARId is not use for creates
remove ", for testing" comment
verify on create that we check to see if its already created

events need the version of the AR they represent (really we need a way to order the events so we play them back in the correct order)

==========

make CreateTestEvent public?
put CreateTestEvent in TestingEvents namespace?
make event specs not have Specifications in the namespace?

rename EventStore project to EventStores.EventStore?
move InMemoryEventStore to it's own project? (although it isn't currently used)

what to do with ParticipantHandlerTests, ParticipantTests namespace? would be nice if it was under Participant

what to do with AggregateRootSpecifications? would be nice if it was under AggregateRoot

what to do with EventStoreSpecifications and InMemoryEventStoreSpecifications? would be nice if it was under EventStores
